This plugin dynamically shows a preview tooltip for hyperlinks on your WordPress site.


== Description ==

This plugin displays thumbnails for hyperlinks that exist on a Wordpress page.
It's configurable whether you'd like to preview all, only external or specially
marked hyperlinks.

This plugin uses the thumbshots of http://fadeout.de, a pretty cool site
which offers the thumbnail service for free.

For the tooltip effect a library called "jQuery Tooltip" is used (currently v1.3).
