This plugin dynamically shows a preview tooltip for hyperlinks on your WordPress site.


== Description ==

This plugin displays thumbnails for hyperlinks that exist on a Wordpress page.
It's configurable whether you'd like to preview all, only external or specially
marked hyperlinks.

This plugin uses the thumbshots of http://fadeout.de, a pretty cool site
which offers the thumbnail service for free.

For the tooltip effect a library called "jQuery Tooltip" is used (currently v1.3).

== Changelog ==

= 1.999 =
* Added an option to define where the javascript code should be placed on a page (in html head tag or the footer).
* Added an input field for page IDs to limit the plugin to only explicitely defined pages. This is a very basic version at the moment.

= 1.99 =
* Changed a variable name which caused trouble with the start page definition (Thx Frank)

= 1.9 =
* Added new config option for a localized dummy tooltip (de = "Thumbshot wird erstellt"; en = "coming soon").

= 1.8 =
* Set thumbnail border to "none" because of some buggy css stylesheets.
* Added a filter, so that only http* links are previewed automatically when the setting "external" or "all" is set. (Thx Bernhard)

= 1.7 =
* Deleted a needless whitespace character that might have caused some problems with other plugins.

= 1.4 =
* Changed opacity from 0.8 to 0.9 for a better image representation.
* Added option to adjust the tooltip opacity.

= 1.3 =
* Added the possibility to choose from different tooltip sizes.

= 1.2 =
* Surrounded the wp_head() function with the plugins_loaded() method
  to avoid some issues regarding the "headers already sent" error.
