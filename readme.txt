This plugin dynamically shows a preview tooltip for hyperlinks on your WordPress site.


== Description ==

This plugin displays thumbnails for hyperlinks that exist on a Wordpress page.
It's configurable whether you'd like to preview all, only external or specially
marked hyperlinks.

This plugin uses the thumbshots of http://fadeout.de, a pretty cool site
which offers the thumbnail service for free.

For the tooltip effect a library called "jQuery Tooltip" is used (currently v1.3).

UPDATE 2010-08-09:
I got a lot of responses relating to new features and I'm already planning the implementations.
So thanks for your feedback and stay tuned for more news to arrive. :-)


== Installation ==

1. Upload the directory 'fadeout' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Make your settings through the 'Settings' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why does it take a couple of mouse hovers to get the link image to appear? =

It's not a bug - it's a mechanism.
The plugin doesn't generate the thumbnails directly. The script sends a request for the thumbnail to the service of http://fadeout.de. If the URL is requested for the first time, it'll be put in a queue - and you see a "coming soon". After a few moments the thumbnail is created at fadeout.de, so if you hover the link, the request for the thumbnail is successful and it's served and shown correctly.


== Screenshots ==

1. This screenshot shows the tooltip preview which is shown while holding the mouse cursor over the WordPress.org hyperlink.

= 1.999 =
* Added an option to define where the javascript code should be placed on a page (in html head tag or the footer).

* Set thumbnail border to "none" because of some buggy css stylesheets.

* Deleted a needless whitespace character that might have caused some problems with other plugins.
